BackDoor with Python

Description:
This GitHub repository provides a Python-based remote access tool (RAT) with keylogger functionality. The tool allows remote control of a target client's system and includes features such as file extraction, file upload, photo capture, screen capture, folder navigation, and a keylogger. The RAT leverages ngrok for remote access, enabling usage outside of the local network. It is important to note that this repository is intended for educational purposes only, and the user assumes full responsibility for the usage and consequences of the provided code.

Features:

File Extraction: The RAT enables remote extraction of files from the target client's system. This feature can be utilized to retrieve specific files or gather information of interest.

File Upload: Users can remotely upload files to the target client's system using the RAT. This functionality provides a means to deliver files or execute specific actions on the target machine.

Photo Capture and Transmission: The RAT allows for remote capturing of photos using the client's camera. The captured images can be transmitted to the server for analysis or viewing.

Screen Capture: Users can initiate remote screen captures on the target client's system. This feature allows for real-time observation of the target's screen or capturing screenshots for later analysis.

Folder Navigation: The RAT includes functionality for remote navigation through the target client's file system. Users can explore folders, list directory contents, and access specific files of interest.

Keylogger: The RAT incorporates a keylogger that logs keystrokes on the target client's system. This feature captures user input, including typed passwords and sensitive information, which can be retrieved remotely.

ngrok Integration: The repository integrates ngrok to establish a secure tunnel, enabling remote access to the RAT even when the client and server are not on the same network. This facilitates remote control and monitoring from any location.

Please note that the keylogger feature should only be used for educational purposes and with the explicit consent of the target. Unauthorized usage or intrusion into someone's privacy is strictly prohibited and may be illegal. Use this code responsibly and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations.
